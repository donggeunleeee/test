  <h2>SELF INTRO</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm Dong Geun Lee, currently exploring my passions in the digital world. Originally from Daegu, I was born on October 12, 1999. My journey into technology and design began with a fascination for creating meaningful user experiences. I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate, constantly seeking new challenges that push me to grow. Outside of work, I enjoy staying active and exploring different cultures through travel and food.</p>
  <p>In terms of education, I've pursued courses in digital design and front-end development, honing my skills in UX/UI design and HTML/CSS. I've also collaborated on diverse projects that have sharpened my problem-solving abilities and creativity. Looking ahead, I'm excited about opportunities to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals who share my passion for pushing the boundaries of digital innovation.</p>
